                Computer architecture is the foundation upon which all computing systems are built. This comprehensive lecture series has been developed over years of teaching experience at the University of Peradeniya, refined through continuous interaction with students and industry feedback. The materials presented here represent a careful balance between theoretical foundations and practical applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                The journey through computer architecture begins with fundamental abstractions and progressively builds towards understanding complex systems including multicore processors, cache hierarchies, and virtual memory. Each lecture is designed to be both self-contained and part of a larger narrative that reveals how modern computers achieve their remarkable capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                These materials are intended for undergraduate students in computer engineering and computer science, as well as professionals seeking to deepen their understanding of computer systems. The accompanying video lectures provide additional context and explanations that complement the written notes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope this series serves you well in your journey to master computer architecture, whether you're building the next generation of processors or simply seeking to understand the remarkable machines that have transformed our world.

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Video Lectures:</strong> Watch the corresponding YouTube video for each lecture to get a comprehensive explanation with visual aids and real-time problem-solving demonstrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Written Notes:</strong> Use these detailed notes as reference material during and after watching videos. They include additional examples and clarifications.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Labs:</strong> Apply concepts through hands-on programming exercises in ARM assembly and Verilog HDL.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Learning:</strong> Pause videos to work through examples independently before seeing solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> Review previous lectures periodically to reinforce foundational concepts.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Recommended Study Approach</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Read the lecture notes introduction to understand key topics</li>
                <li>Watch the video lecture, taking brief notes on unclear concepts</li>
                <li>Re-read the detailed notes, focusing on sections that need clarification</li>
                <li>Complete any associated laboratory exercises</li>
                <li>Review key takeaways and summary sections</li>

                Computer architecture is the science and art of designing computer systems. It sits at the critical intersection of hardware and software, defining how processors execute instructions, how memory is organized, and how data flows through a system. Understanding computer architecture is essential for anyone who wants to write efficient code, design new computing systems, or optimize existing ones.
              </p>

                  This lecture introduces processor microarchitecture, focusing
                  on implementing the MIPS ISA through hardware design. The
                  lecture covers MIPS instruction types, basic digital logic
                  review, datapath construction, and single-cycle processor
                  design.

                  This lecture covers the design of the control unit for a MIPS
                  processor, with specific focus on generating ALU control
                  signals through a two-stage approach. The lecture builds upon
                  the datapath elements covered previously and demonstrates how
                  control signals are generated from instruction opcodes and
                  function fields.

                  This lecture completes the single-cycle MIPS processor design
                  by analyzing control signals for all instruction types
                  (R-type, Branch, Load, Store, Jump), introduces timing
                  analysis with delay values, and demonstrates performance
                  limitations that motivate multi-cycle and pipelined
                  implementations.

                  pipelining efficiency, and discusses solutions including

                  pipeline operation, introduces pipeline registers required
                  between stages, examines load/store instruction execution

                  includes practical exercises on clock frequency calculation
                  and pipeline optimization.

                  This lecture introduces memory systems, starting with
                  historical context and transitioning into the fundamental
                  concepts of cache memory and memory hierarchy.

                  This lecture continues the discussion on cache memory,
                  focusing on detailed read and write operations in a
                  direct-mapped cache, handling cache misses, and introducing
                  write policies (specifically write-through). The lecture
                  explores how the cache controller manages different access
                  scenarios and maintains data consistency.

                Dr. Isuru Nawinne received his B.Sc. degree in Engineering from
                the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka (2011), and his Ph.D. in
                Computer Science and Engineering from the University of New
                South Wales, Sydney, Australia (2016). He teaches one of the
                best computer architecture foundational courses in the world,
                with materials and delivery methods that consistently produce
                impressive outcomes. His students often pursue PhD research at world renowned universities, and are regularly recruited by world-leading computer architecture companies including ARM and SiFive.
